Accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you acknowledge that any consumer protection rights, laws, and/or remedies do not apply to your use of the Platform or any of its components.

## 3. Platform and Underlying Infrastructure

### 3.1. Platform and Blockchain-Based Infrastructure

#### 3.1.1. Platform

While the Platform allows you to access and interact with certain Blockchain-Based Infrastructure, such as Protocol and Markets, it does not form a part thereof, constitutes a distinct software, and serves exclusively as a mere web-based interface to access and interact with them. You hereby acknowledge that there might be other interfaces enabling interaction with the Blockchain-Based Infrastructure or its specific components, that have no connection to or affiliation with us.

#### 3.1.2. Blockchain-Based Infrastructure

In general, the Blockchain-Based Infrastructure and its components are deployed on blockchain network(s). We do not control or operate such underlying blockchain networks and any software through which they are formed. Any malfunction, breakdown, or abandonment of the Blockchain-Based Infrastructure's underlying blockchain network(s) could significantly impact the Platform or transactions involving Virtual Assets. You are solely responsible for conducting thorough research before interacting with the Platform and underlying Blockchain-Based Infrastructure, and any use thereof is entirely at your own risk.

#### 3.1.3. Protocol

The Protocol is a permissionless infrastructure layer (akin to a construction kit) consisting of Smart Contracts deployed on public blockchain networks, the primary purpose of which is to enable Market Curators to assemble, deploy, and manage Markets. The Smart Contracts comprising the Protocol are immutable, except for certain contracts that function as the Tooling Catalogue, which is mutable only to permit the addition or removal of specific tools, configurations, or components for prospective use by Market Curators. Nonetheless, any changes to the Tooling Catalogue have a catalogue effect only and do not alter, amend, impair, or otherwise interfere with Markets or Protocol's Smart Contracts already deployed, nor confer any operational, custodial, supervisory, or managerial control over the Protocol, instance owners, Markets, or Virtual Assets. Any inclusion or availability of components in the Tooling Catalogue or Third-Party Service integrations therein shall not constitute a recommendation, solicitation, due-diligence finding, warranty, or endorsement. It is the responsibility of Market Curators to independently review, test, and verify the Protocol and relevant Tooling Catalogue components before using or deploying them on the blockchain, whether in connection with a Market or otherwise. Any integrated Third-Party Services are operated independently and may change, fail, be insecure, inaccurate, unavailable, or delayed; their availability, security, correctness, performance, and operation are outside our control. To the fullest extent permitted by law, neither Gearbox, the GEAR DAO, nor any of their affiliates, contributors, or service providers shall be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, error, malfunction, misconfiguration, unavailability, inaccuracy, or other adverse event arising from or relating to the Protocol, Tooling Catalogue (or any of its components and Third-Party Service integrations), Markets (including their assembling, configuration, or deployment by a Market Curator), or the underlying blockchain networks, save that nothing herein excludes or limits any liability that cannot lawfully be excluded or limited, including liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

### 3.2. Platform-Displayed Data

All information about Markets and Market Curators shown on the Platform is provided by Market Curators or sourced through Third-Party Services. As an interface provider, we determine which data are displayed on the Platform. However, we do not verify such information and make no representation or warranty, express or implied, that any data displayed through the Platform are accurate, complete, true, timely, reliable, or non-misleading, or that any particular data will be provided or remain available via the Platform at any time.

### 3.3. Intended Software Logic

You are required to comply with the intended logic of the Platform and underlying Blockchain-Based Infrastructure. Bugs, flaws in logic, and other vulnerabilities are not part of their intended operation. Exploiting bugs, flaws, or vulnerabilities in the Platform and/or Blockchain-Based Infrastructure, regardless of purposes or circumstances, is strictly prohibited, and any associated or resulting transactions will be considered void and null from the outset (_ab initio)_. Any such acts, including those harming other users, may be treated as criminal or other offences under the applicable law. Funds acquired through violation of the intended logic of the Platform or underlying Blockchain-Based Infrastructure, or taking advantage of flaws, bugs, errors, or vulnerabilities therein shall be deemed unlawfully obtained, and may be further subject to forfeiture under the applicable law or other adverse consequences.

### 3.4. Our Role and Non-Party Status

Our role is strictly limited to operating, providing, and maintaining the Platform, which enables access to certain Blockchain-Based Infrastructure, such as the Protocol and Markets, and Third-Party Services the Platform or Protocol relies on. We are not involved in any transactions involving Virtual Assets that you conduct, whether through the Platform or otherwise, including with the use of Blockchain-Based Infrastructure. All legal relationships and obligations for such transactions exist solely between you and the corresponding counterparty. We do not act as a party or intermediary to these transactions, and accept no responsibility or liability for any disputes that may arise. Such disputes must be resolved directly between you and the respective counterparty.

### 3.5. Updates and Availability

The Platform's functionality and features may be outlined in the Materials or communicated by us or on our behalf via the Communication Channels. The Platform, including its underlying technical infrastructure and software, may be terminated, suspended, updated, or modified at any time with or without a reason or prior notice, and without any liability whatsoever. The Platform or its components may also become inaccessible or inoperable due to maintenance, updates, disruptions, cyberattacks, technical issues, Force Majeure Circumstances, unavailability of Third-Party Services, and so forth. Access may also be limited, suspended, or restricted with immediate effect and without notification and liability, regardless of reason, including if you violate these Terms or applicable laws, create legal exposure for us or Affiliates, are identified as a Prohibited Person or act on their behalf, or your Wallet fails to complete applicable screening procedures. The Platform may integrate software, solutions, or tools to (i) identify Prohibited Persons, (ii) screen your Wallets to adhere to international Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) regulations, as well as to comply with global crypto regulatory requirements, and/or (iii) users violating these Terms or laws. You must comply with all limitations outlined in these Terms and not attempt to circumvent or bypass them. Any termination or suspension of the Platform, its features, or components shall not affect your ability to access and use the Blockchain-Based Infrastructure or its components, which operate autonomously and remain available directly on the relevant blockchain.

## 4. Markets and Market Curators

### 4.1. Markets and Market Terms

Each Market is a separate autonomous software, distinct from the Platform and Protocol itself, and, therefore, does not form a part thereof. Each specific Market and its use shall be governed by the relevant Smart Contracts comprising such Market, and, by interacting with a Market, you consent to the automatic processing of your transactions by the applicable Smart Contracts in accordance with the applicable Market Strategy, terms and other parameters established by such Market's Smart Contracts. If a Market Curator provides any Market Terms, they shall be in addition to these Terms and not in lieu thereof. In the event of any discrepancy or conflict between these Terms, Smart Contracts, and/or Market Terms, these Terms shall take precedence regarding all legal and judicial matters relating to the Platform and its underlying Blockchain-Based Infrastructure, and the parameters of Smart Contracts – regarding all matters pertaining to transactions involving Virtual Assets. The Market Terms shall apply to the extent they are consistent with, and not overridden by, these Terms or the Market's Smart Contracts.

### 4.2. No Liability, Validation, and Testing

We do not review, evaluate, verify, test, examine, or validate any Market. As a material condition of your use of the Platform, you acknowledge and agree that we shall not be liable for any Market or Market Curator, and we expressly disclaim all liability arising from or relating to them. If a specific Market is displayed within the Platform, it shall not be interpreted or construed as our endorsement or recommendation of such a Market or its Market Curator, nor as a confirmation that the Market or its Market Curator has been reviewed, verified, tested, assessed, or validated in any manner; as a Market Curator, you must not make any statements implying otherwise. Before making any interaction with a Market, you shall independently evaluate and verify such Market, assess the Market Curator, and carefully review the applicable Market Terms, if any. The Markets consist of open-source Smart Contracts deployed on public blockchain, which are freely available for inspection and review by any person. Any interactions with a Market undertaken by you and any related actions taken shall be at your own discretion and risk, and you shall be solely responsible for any loss, damage, or other consequences arising from such interaction.

### 4.3. Tooling Catalogue and Market Strategies

A Market Curator has sole and absolute discretion over the configuration of their Markets, and is solely responsible for independently reviewing, testing, and selecting all components and configurations of the Market, including those drawn from the Tooling Catalogue, as well as any other items, data, or elements used in or in connection with the Market. The determination of whether to use, omit, or select any particular component, configuration, or integration in the Market shall rest exclusively with the Market Curator, who shall independently verify the correctness, suitability, and current applicability of each selected component, configuration, integration, or any data relied upon. A Market and applicable Market Strategy may be updated only by the relevant Market Curator, and no other person has technical ability to update, configure, or interfere with an existing Market. We do not review, audit, or verify Market Strategies and data on which they rely. Any assumptions, models, plans, estimates, projections, or expectations used in creating Market Strategies may be inaccurate, outdated, incomplete, or otherwise misleading, and may result in adverse outcomes for your transactions. A Market Strategy may not be suitable for you, and there is no guarantee it will be profitable or beneficial. Before interacting with any Market, you must independently review and assess the applicable Market Strategy.

### 4.4. No Control or Influence

Neither we nor GEAR DAO create, control, operate, administer, or manage any Markets, nor control, direct, or supervise any Market Curators. We make no warranties, whether express or implied, with respect to Markets, their performance, operation, functionality, or security, including implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, as well as any warranties implied by the course of deal, conduct, or otherwise, all of which are expressly disclaimed and denied. Any use of and interaction with Markets, as well as all associated relationships and obligations, is solely between you and the relevant Market Curators at your own discretion and risk. Neither we nor GEAR DAO accept any responsibility or liability for any such use, including any losses or damages sustained, including the loss of Virtual Assets.

### 4.5. No Personalised Approach

All decisions and actions regarding Markets, including their configuration, Market Strategies, applicable thresholds, and risk parameters are not, typically, based on the specific goals or risk tolerance of individual users, nor they are influenced by individual user requests or intended to constitute personalised recommendations tailored to any particular user's financial condition or objectives. Always do your own research before interacting with any Market or otherwise transacting with Virtual Assets.

### 4.6. Decision-Making

In some situations, market or other changes affecting the Market may require quick action. This could include updating the Market Strategy or taking other steps in response to market movements. In such cases, timely analysis of available data is essential for making informed decisions. However, there is always an inherent risk of potential delays in the provision of necessary information. Such circumstances may result in negative impacts on the Markets and associated transactions, including the partial or total loss of Virtual Assets used in connection with the Markets, and, by interacting with a Market, you acknowledge and assume such risks.

### 4.7. Release

As a Market Curator, you are solely responsible for the assemblage, deployment, configuration, and management of your Markets. We are not liable for any losses or damages, including consequential, incidental, or indirect damages, resulting from or arising in connection with your deployment, configuration and management of Markets, as well as any interaction with or use of such Markets by the Platform users. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release and forever discharge the Gearbox Parties from any and all actions, claims, suits, demands, losses, damages, obligations, or liabilities of any kind, whether known or unknown, arising from or related to the above.

## 5. Rewards

### 5.1. Earning Rewards

When using the Protocol, Platform, or Markets, you may earn Rewards. Participation in any activities or transactions that may lead to earning Rewards is entirely voluntary. Please note that earning Rewards does not guarantee that they can be converted into any assets, provide benefits, deliver specific outcomes, or meet your expectations. Even if Rewards are earned, there is no assurance of their value, profitability, or potential use. In general, Rewards do not constitute any consideration or compensation, nor do they entitle you to any return, passive income, interest, or other similar benefits. They also do not grant you ownership rights, equity, revenue shares, intellectual property rights, or any other form of participation in or related to us, our Affiliates, or the Platform.

### 5.2. Parameters and Requirements

All terms and conditions related to Rewards and associated activities, including their form, allocation, calculation, and participation requirements, are determined solely by a person that allocates and distributes them. Rewards programs and related activities, along with their rules, eligibility criteria, or other features, may be changed, adjusted, suspended, or cancelled at any time, with or without notice, and without liability to you. You are responsible for following all applicable rules, requirements, and limitations related to Rewards and related activities. Any attempt to manipulate, bypass, or otherwise violate these rules is strictly prohibited.

### 5.3. Distribution of Rewards

To receive Rewards, you must follow the instructions provided on the Platform, in the Materials, or otherwise communicated to you by the providers of such Rewards. Some Rewards may have limited claim periods. If you cannot be reached, are found ineligible, or fail to claim your Rewards within the specified timeframe, your right to receive them may automatically cease, and they will be forfeited. Rewards will not be distributed if doing so would violate any applicable laws, regulations, or government orders affecting their provider, us, you, the Platform, or the respective Rewards.

### 5.4. Violation

If you violate these Terms or any other applicable rules or requirements, any Rewards may be withheld and retained as fair compensation for the violation. Where technically possible, your participation in related activities may also be suspended or terminated.

## 6. Wallets

### 6.1. General

When using the Platform, you may connect your Wallet to it through one of the compatible third-party solutions, including software wallets. All Wallets or software wallets you use within the Platform are considered Third-Party Services, and we neither endorse them nor shall be held liable or responsible in connection therewith. When using them, you should carefully review their applicable terms and policies. You may disconnect your Wallet from the Platform at any time.

### 6.2. Wallet Screening

When connecting your Wallet to the Platform, it may be subject to automated compliance screening to ensure adherence to applicable Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF), and other regulatory requirements. Such screening may take into account blockchain data and other indicators to identify risks related to, without limitation, involvement with sanctioned persons or entities, terrorism financing, hacked or stolen funds, fraudulent transactions, etc. If your Wallet is determined to present any risk or legal exposure, your access to the Platform functionality may be restricted or blocked automatically. Any such determination is final and is not subject to review or appeal.

### 6.3. Security

Neither we nor the Platform have access to or control over your Wallets or Virtual Assets held in them. You must not share your Wallet credentials or allow others to access them. You are fully responsible for (i) securing your Virtual Assets, Wallets, and associated credentials; (ii) keeping your Wallet credentials confidential and ensuring their proper use; and (iii) all transactions made through your Wallets or using credentials thereto, and all such transactions will be considered to have been made personally by you.

### 6.4. Loss of Access

We do not store any credentials associated with your Wallets on our servers. Since these credentials and other Wallet-related information are not backed up, we cannot restore them if they are lost.

### 6.5. Release

We are not liable for any losses or damages, including consequential, incidental, or indirect damages, resulting from the unauthorised use of your Wallets. This includes cases where you fail to maintain the confidentiality of your Wallet credentials. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release and forever discharge the Gearbox Parties from any and all actions, claims, suits, demands, losses, damages, obligations, or liabilities of any kind, whether known or unknown, arising from or related to the above.

## 7. User Instructions

### 7.1. General

You are responsible for ensuring that all your User Instructions are complete and accurate. We are not obligated to verify their correctness, accuracy, authenticity, or validity, nor will we be obligated to monitor or reject them for any reason, even if they appear to be duplicates. However, the Platform may automatically reject your User Instructions if they violate its intended logic, or if there are doubts about their accuracy, authenticity, or validity. In such cases, you may be required to take further actions regarding the relevant User Instruction.

### 7.2. Submission

By submitting a User Instruction, you initiate the corresponding transaction, which may result in transferring to or deducting Virtual Assets from your Wallet in accordance with your User Instruction. If your Wallet has insufficient Virtual Assets to complete the transaction, including covering applicable Third-Party Costs, the transaction will not be processed, and the User Instruction may be rejected. User Instructions are irrevocable; once submitted, you have no right to rescind or withdraw them. We make no guarantees that any User Instruction or associated transaction will be completed successfully, within a specific timeframe, or at all.

### 7.3. Disclaimers

By providing a User Instruction, you agree and understand that: (i) your User Instruction is considered unsolicited, i.e. solely initiated by you; (ii) you have not received any advice from us in connection with any User Instruction; and (iii) we do not conduct a suitability review of any User Instruction you submit.

### 7.4. Security

You acknowledge that User Instructions transmitted via the Platform are generally sent over the Internet and may pass through public, transnational networks that are not specifically secured. There is no guarantee regarding the protection against unauthorised access, and you accept the associated risks.

### 7.5. Records

We shall have the right to maintain records of all User Instructions and associated transaction data to ensure the security of the Platform and its users, including fraud prevention, abuse detection, and compliance with legal obligations, where applicable. Our records of all User Instructions shall be conclusive and binding on you for all purposes.

## 8. Fees, Third-Party Costs, Taxes

### 8.1. Platform Fees

Currently, neither we nor the Platform charge any fees for its use on our behalf. However, we reserve the right to introduce certain fees for the use of the Platform or any of its components at any time at our sole and absolute discretion. If we introduce Platform fees, we will add a notice to this effect on the Platform. However, you hereby agree and acknowledge that it is your sole obligation to review the applicable fees each time you use the Platform.

### 8.2. Third-Party Costs

When conducting transactions through the Platform, you may incur certain Third-Party Costs, which explicitly include the Protocol Fees, Market Fees, and network fees (gas costs). You are solely responsible for all applicable Third-Party Costs, and we bear no liability for them. Depending on the transaction, the Third-Party Costs may be automatically deducted from your Wallet or the Virtual Assets involved in a transaction. We may display Protocol Fees and Market Fees on the Platform, but we do not guarantee that any fees will be displayed, or that any such display will be timely, accurate, complete, or correct. It is your responsibility to independently verify and review any Third-Party Costs associated with your transactions.

### 8.3. Taxes

You are solely responsible for all current and future Taxes applicable to you that may arise from or relate to the transactions made by you through or in relation to the Platform. This includes all Taxes imposed, levied, collected, withheld, or assessed by any state or governmental authority. It is your obligation to manage your tax responsibilities, as failure to do so may result in penalties, fines, or other legal consequences.

## 9. Content and Intellectual Property

## 16. Communication

### 16.1. Communication Terms

We will send you information concerning these Terms and the Platform electronically, including via the Communication Channels we choose. All such Communications will be deemed valid, in writing, and legally binding, and will be considered delivered to you on the day after they are published or transmitted. You can contact us at [legal@gearbox.foundation](mailto:legal@gearbox.foundation). We might ask for additional information to verify your identity.

### 16.2. Communication Disclaimers

You shall always carefully assess and verify any information you access or receive via the Communication Channels. You must cross-verify any hyperlinks and Wallet addresses provided through the Communication Channels for authenticity, correctness, and accuracy by cross-referencing them with our other Communication Channels or through our officially designated moderators before relying on or using such information or details, or performing any transactions involving Virtual Assets. Be extra cautious regarding any hyperlinks, Wallet addresses, or instructions on executing blockchain transactions, which are shared only through one Communication Channel. There is always a risk that one or more of our Communication Channels may be compromised, which is a common occurrence in the blockchain space, resulting in unauthorised third parties gaining control over them and posting or sending misleading information in an attempt to steal or gain control over your assets. Accordingly, you hereby assume such risks and the responsibility to reasonably verify and assess any and all information you receive or access through our Communication Channels, at the very least by means mentioned herein. No Gearbox Party shall be held liable or responsible for, or in connection with, your reliance upon or use of unauthentic or misleading information or communications shared through the Communication Channels as a result of our loss of control or their compromise. We hereby disclaim any duty of care with respect thereto and shall not be held liable or responsible for any damages or losses sustained by you in connection with, or resulting from, the compromise of our Communication Channels.

### 19.2. Rules of Interpretation

Unless the context requires otherwise, references to one gender include all genders; singular includes plural and _vice versa_; terms like "including", "in particular", or "for example" are illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the following words; Section headings do not affect interpretation hereof; these Terms will not be construed to our disadvantage for preparing them. The terms "investment", "investor", "invest", "returns", "interest", "collateral", "credit," "leverage," "derivative," "borrow", "lend," "yield," and other similar terms, as may be used within the Platform or in the Materials, are not meant to be interpreted literally. Rather, such terms are being used to draw rough, fuzzy-logic analogies between the heavily automated and mostly deterministic operations of decentralised Smart Contracts and the discretionary performance of traditional off-chain transactions. When you access and use the Protocol or other Smart Contracts, there are no legal agreements, promises of payment, or courts of law, and therefore there are no investments, or other traditional transactions involved.
